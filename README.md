Mindy - The Mindfulness Helper

# Next steps: make it ready for marketing
	- "about": map, addresses, phone numbers 
	- make it free for emails, but SMS free tier should only be...
		- 1 per week? which means ~4*0.01*10_000=400 dollars a month. Which would need 80 paying users to cover.
		- or 10 per month which means ~ 10 * 0.01 * 10_000 which means at 10k users, $1000 per month -> we need 200 paying users (2%).
		- or at 5 per month -> 5 * 0.01 * 10_000 users -> we need 100 paying users (1%) to maintain this. 
		- or more in general:
			- if we send X texts per month, that means for each 100 users we pay X*0.01*100 = X $ per month. Which means each user costs X/100 per month. Which means that if we we get 5$ per paying user... each user pays for... too complicated. But it works out that for 
				5 messages per month -> 1% of users must be paying users
				10 messages per month -> 2% of users must be paying 
				...
				500 messages per month -> 100% of users must pay.
				(5$ buys 500 messages per month)
